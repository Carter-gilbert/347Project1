    <h1>About Collegiate Overwatch</h1>

    <h3><span class="orange">Collegiate Overwatch </span>is where the best college eSports players compete in North America. </h3>
    <h3>Colleges around the United States, Mexico, and Canada get their best players together to compete in tournaments. This year the <span class="orange">Overwatch Collegiate Homecoming</span> will run for 2 months with teams competing every weekend for
        a spot in the championship. With $27,600 dollars on the line, the teams take it quite seriously. Does your school have what it takes to win it all?</h3>
    <h3>This year the <span class="orange">Overwatch </span> team is working with JMU X-Labs to create an official team. Thanks to this partner we now have a space where we can practice and compete together in the same room while on campus. With the help
        from X-Labs, the goal is to create an eSports program at JMU that rivals other big names in the state. </h3>
