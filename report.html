            All of the content on my website is original and not lifted from other web pages. Also, all images are royalty-free and none require citation for the versions I used. My website has 5 different pages: Home, who are we, what is overwatch, tournaments,
            and contact us. The website also has a header with 5 different navigation links bringing the user to the different pages. The pages also fit mobile properly, specifically the who are we page which completely changes in mobile view. There is
            a CSS style sheet that holds the CSS styling for the things that are constant across the pages. All images also have alt attributes and all pages have a favicon. Each page also compiles without any errors and most content is left-aligned,
            and content that is aligned to the middle does not have issues resizing or on small screens. My webpage also has two different font faces between the title and the paragraph and subheadings. My webpage also has a few animations, one being
            on the contact us page where hovering over the icons creates a glow. There is another one when you are on mobile after clicking on the hamburger menu. There is also an animation when you click on the images of people which presents the user
            with more information about each player. Finally, I have been working on my website for weeks and making incremental changes along the way.
