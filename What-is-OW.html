    <h1>What is <span class="orange">Overwatch?</span></h1>


    <h2>Overwatch is a team based first person shooter where each team is composed of 2 tank, damage, and healer heros. </h2>
    <br>
    <h3>A<span class="bold orange"> tank</span> is a hero with higher than average health and usually has an ability to protect the rest of the team from damage. Many tanks have a shield which can block incoming damage from the other team for a short period
        of time.
    </h3>
    <h3>A<span class="bold orange"> damage hero</span>, also known as a damage per second (DPS) hero, has a high rate of damage and their job is to deal damage to the shields and other team's players. </h3>
    <h3>A<span class="bold orange"> healer</span> is a hero that is able to restore health to other heros after they have taken damage from the other team. Their abilities generally enhance the other heros making them more effective against the enemy team.</h3>
