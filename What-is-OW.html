    <h1>What is <span class="orange">Overwatch?</span></h1>


    <h2>Overwatch is a team based first person shooter where each team is composed of 6 heros. </h2>
    <br>
    <h2 class="bold">There are 3 Types of Heros:</h2>
    <h3>A<span class="bold orange"> tank</span> is a hero with higher than average health and usually has an ability to protect the rest of the team from damage. Many tanks have a shield which can block incoming damage from the other team for a short period
        of time.
    </h3>
    <h3>A<span class="bold orange"> damage hero</span>, also known as a damage per second (DPS) hero, has a high rate of damage and their job is to deal damage to the shields and other team's players. </h3>
    <h3>A<span class="bold orange"> healer</span> is a hero that is able to restore health to other heros after they have taken damage from the other team. Their abilities generally enhance the other heros making them more effective against the enemy team.</h3>

    <br>
    <h2 class="bold">There are 4 Main Gamemodes:</h2>
    <h3><span class="bold orange"> Assault </span>is a gamemode where the attacking team must capture two points while the other team tries to defend the point from being captured.</h3>
    <h3><span class="bold orange"> Control:</span> is a gamemode where both teams fight over control of the same point, best of 3 wins!</h3>
    <h3><span class="bold orange"> Escort </span> is a gamemode where the attacking team must push a payload along a track to its destination. </h3>
    <h3><span class="bold orange"> Hybrid</span> is a gamemode that is a hybrid of assault and escort. The attacking team must capture an objective then push the payload to its destination.</h3>
